                <h3>1. Protect Birds from Glass Collisions</h3>
                Collisions with glass is a major human threat to birds, killing up to 1 billion birds annually in the U.S. alone. Because birds see differently than we do, glass poses a serious risk, especially when vegetation or other habitat is reflected in windows.

            <h3> 2. Say "No" to Pesticides </h3>
            You can live a bird-friendly life by avoiding use of toxic pesticides. Neonicotinoids are currently the most widely used type of insecticide, and can be found in common products like insect sprays and seed treatments. One seed coated with this pesticide is enough to kill a songbird, and even less can harm a bird's reproduction. ABC has fought to block or restrict these dangerous chemicals in homes and gardens, and in agricultural settings by insisting that regulatory decisions be grounded in science.
